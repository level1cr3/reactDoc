Alright, let’s slow it down and walk through **exactly** what happens under the hood.

We’ll zoom in on just the key actors:

* **Your component** (Albums)
* **`getAlbums()`** (returns a Promise)
* **React Suspense** (controls loading)
* **`use()`** (waits for the Promise to resolve)

---

## 1️⃣ First render

You wrote:

```tsx
const albums = use(getAlbums());
```

When React starts rendering **for the first time**:

* `getAlbums()` is called → it creates a **brand-new Promise** and starts a 3-second timer.
* `use()` sees this Promise is still pending → it says to React: “I can’t finish right now, throw me into Suspense.”
* React *stops rendering Albums* and shows your Suspense fallback (loading spinner, etc.).
* **React keeps that Promise around** and waits for it to settle.

---

## 2️⃣ Promise resolves

After 3 seconds:

* The Promise from step 1 resolves with your album array.
* React says, “Okay, I can retry rendering that component now.”

---

## 3️⃣ React retries the render

When React retries:

* It starts **fresh** from the top of your component function.
* That means it **calls `getAlbums()` again**.
* And `getAlbums()` makes a **new Promise**, with a *new* 3-second timer.
* `use()` sees *this* new Promise is pending → Suspends again.
* Suspense fallback shows again.
* React will now wait for this **new** Promise to resolve.

---

## 4️⃣ The cycle repeats forever

Every retry creates a **new Promise** → `use()` suspends again → Suspense never gets past “loading.”

---

## 💡 Why caching fixes it

If you do:

```ts
const albumsPromise = getAlbums(); // created once
```

Then on retries:

* `use()` always gets the **same Promise object**.
* On the first render, it’s pending → Suspense fallback shows.
* When it resolves, React retries the render → calls `use()` with the **same Promise**, but this time it’s already resolved → `use()` just gives you the value → done.

---

### 🎯 The key rule:

> With Suspense, you **must** give `use()` the *same* Promise instance across renders until it resolves.
> If you give it a *new* Promise each time, you’re effectively telling React “still loading” forever.

If you want, I can make you a **step-by-step diagram** showing the timeline with and without caching, so you can literally see where React keeps replacing the Promise and why it gets stuck. That visual usually makes it click instantly.
